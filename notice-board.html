        <h1>Notice Board Page</h1>
        <p>The 'Notice Board' page will act as a central hub for all the latest updates, notices, and news 
            from the HTL Ministries administration. It will keep our community informed about upcoming 
            events, ministry announcements, and important developments. Each notice will provide 
            essential details, and where relevant, these sections will include links to the 'Support Us' 
            page, encouraging visitors to take action by contributing to the initiatives discussed.
            
            For example, if we announce a new project or an urgent need for support, the notice will 
            feature a direct call-to-action, leading visitors to the support page where they can 
            immediately contribute. By keeping our community informed and actively engaging 
            them through these updates, we can encourage greater participation in HTLâ€™s mission.
