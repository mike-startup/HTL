        <h1>About Page</h1>
        <p>The 'About' page will serve as a tribute to the late founder of Healing The Land Ministries, 
            honoring his vision, leadership, and the legacy he left behind. This page will share 
            the story of how the ministry was established, highlighting the founder’s journey, dedication, and passion for the ministries' work.
            
            It will also provide insight into the core values and mission of HTL, as inspired by the
            founder’s original vision. By sharing their story, we aim to connect visitors to the heart of 
            HTL Ministries, showing how the work we continue today is a reflection of the founder’s 
            lasting impact.
            
            This page will offer a personal and emotional connection to the history and purpose of HTL Ministries, 
            helping visitors understand the deeper meaning behind our ministry and why their 
            support is vital.
