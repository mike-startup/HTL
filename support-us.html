        <h1>Support Us Page</h1>
        <p>The support page will be the primary platform for our donors and 
            supporters to contribute financially to Healing The Land Ministries. 
            While the initiatives themselves will be featured in detail on a separate 
            'Initiatives' page, this support page will provide a clear and direct way 
            for visitors to engage with our mission through donations. By focusing on 
            creating a seamless donation experience, the support page will serve 
            as the heart of our fundraising efforts, ensuring that visitors are inspired 
            to support HTLâ€™s mission.</p>
